# BluetoothMessanger
Need to improve the android app. Convert the bluetooth chat thread to Service.

I have copy this whole project from another repository from github, also modified it to meet my requirements.
Now, need to imporve this app.
Basically it is using the arduino esp8266 bluetooth for serial communication. 
The is able to communicate with mobile to mobile also. Need some minor changes and this can be done.

Major part is to convert the ChatController from thread to Service, so that if app goes in background, the connection keep alive.


Thanks
